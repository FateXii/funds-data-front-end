Bonds are issued by governments or corporate entities and may provide an investor with a higher investment return than cash. The managers, which may have different bond investment styles, are given specific mandates aimed at steady growth in capital value and income. Relative to other single manager bond-only portfolios, this portfolio is expected to have lower volatility of returns over the medium term due to the nature of its construction. The portfolio is aimed at investors with a medium-term investment horizon (more than three years). Investment Solutions expects: ! A low probability of capital loss over the medium term ! Investment returns above inflation over the medium term"

As such the investment objective and style of the Portfolio will be full replication of the Index. Accordingly the financial or other condition of any company or entity included from time to time in the Index will not result in the elimination of its securities from the Portfolio, unless the securities of such company or entity are removed from the Index itself. Trading in other instruments replicating the index as permissible by the Act will be allowed.

To provide investors with a real rate of return through cost effective exposure to a diversified portfolio of government bonds. The Ashburton Bond Tracker Fund invests in bonds based on the value issued by National Treasury and the listed value on the JSE. The Ashburton Bond Tracker aims to track the economic performance of the JSE Government Bond Index (GOVI). The GOVI index comprises all bonds issued by the Republic of South Africa that fall into the top 10 positions of the Composite All Bond Index (ALBI). The fund tracks the component bonds of the index in proportion to the index weightings and returns interest to investors semi-annually with no prescribed fixed investment period. The fund has exposure to government bonds, and as a result risks include, but are not limited to; default risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk, market volatility, economic and political risk."

This fund also provides manager diversification which should reduce the volatility relative to single manager funds.The portfolio invests in assets in liquid form, high yielding non-equity securities and interest bearing securities andmay invest in offshore investment. The portfolio's exposure to fixed income investments creates sensitivity tochanges in bond yields. rising interest rates and inflation uncertainty. as well as exposure to economic. political andcredit risk. For credit and income instruments, while unlikely, capital loss may occur due to an event like the defaultof an issuer. This fund has exposure to foreign investment funds and is thereby susceptible to currency risk andpotential macroeconomic and political risks brought about by funds invested across various regions."

A minimum of 20% of the portfolio's market value will be invested in instruments that are constituents of the ALBI or similar/equivalent instruments. The portfolio will have a modified duration band of -1 to +3 years around the ALBI.3.3. Debt Instruments held by the portfolio will be appropriately diversified and will be primarily those issued or guaranteed by a government or those with a credit rating of BBB- (or equivalent) or higher at the time of inclusion in the portfolio. National credit ratings will be used where available.3.4.

Due to the nature of the fund, the majority of the returns through the interest rate cycle will be dominated via income distribution. In order to achieve the objective the fund will invest in interest bearing and non-equity securities (including, but not limited to, bonds, cash deposits, money market and other interest-bearing securities) as well listed and unlisted financial instruments in line with the conditions as determined by legislation from time to time.The underlying investments are actively managed and will change over time to reflect the change in interest rates. The portfolio will predominately invest in South African markets, but is however permitted to include investments in offshore jurisdictions subject to the investment conditions determined by legislation from time to time. The portfolio will be subject to the Prudential Investment Guidelines for South African Retirement Funds, being Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act, or such other legislation published from time to time. The portfolio may apart from assets in liquid form also include participatory interests, exchange traded funds or any other form of participation in portfolios of collective investment schemes or other similar schemes.Where the aforementioned schemes are operated in territories other than in South Africa, participatory interests or any other form of participation in these schemes will be included in the portfolio only where the regulatory environment is to the satisfaction of the manager and trustee and is of a sufficient standard to provide investor protection at least equivalent to that in South Africa.Nothing in the supplemental deed shall preclude the manager from varying the ratios of securities, to maximise capital growth and investment potential in changing economic environments or market conditions or to meet the requirements, if applicable, of any exchange formally recognised in terms of legislation and from retaining cash or placing cash on deposit in terms of the Deed and any Supplemental Deeds thereto; provided that the manager shall ensure that the aggregate value of the assets comprising the portfolio shall consist of securities of the aggregate value required from time to time by the Act."

The portfolio shall not buy or sell securities for the purpose of making a profit nor for any purpose other than tracking the Index. 3. Investors may obtain participatory interests in the portfolio on the secondary market or by subscribing for new participatory interests in the portfolio on the primary market. In order to achieve this object the manager may, subject to the Act and the Deed, create and issue an unlimited number of participatory interests in the portfolio. 4. The portfolio will be passively managed in that the manager will not buy and sell securities based on economic, financial and/or market analysis but rather, will buy and sell securities solely for the purpose of ensuring that the portfolio tracks the Index. As such the investment objective and style of the portfolio will be full replication of the Index. 5. The composition of the portfolio will be adjusted periodically to conform to changes in the composition and weightings of the securities in the Index so as to ensure that the composition and weightings of the portfolio are a reflection of the composition and weighting of the securities contained in the Index. 6. The manager shall further be entitled, in its discretion and only on a temporary basis, to employ such other investment techniques and instruments as will most effectively give effect to the object or the investment policies of the portfolio, subject to the provisions of the Deed and the Act from time to time. 7. Assets in liquid form will form a minor part of the Portfolio's assets. 8. The portfolio's ability to replicate the price and yield performance of the Index will be affected by the costs and expenses incurred by the portfolio. 9. Since the manager will not be distributing to investors any income (including coupons) in the portfolio, the manager will disclose in the portfolio supplements that such income will be reinvested in the portfolio. 10. Any material change in the investment policy of the portfolio shall constitute an amendment of the deed, and shall be subject to the provisions of clause 59 of the deed, in which event investors shall be given reasonable notice to enable them to redeem their participatory interest prior to implementation of the change. 11. The manager shall in managing the assets of the portfolio ensure that it is aligned with limits as prescribed by Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act, 24 of 1956, to the extent allowed by the Act."

    "objectives": "The Prescient Flexible Fixed Interest Fund will aim to preserve capital and maximize income returns without placing undue risk on the capital of the investor. In order to achieve this objective the fund will invest in a diversified range of fixed interest securities, including but not limited to, local and foreign government, semi-government, corporate bonds, fixed deposits, money market and other interest-bearing securities of differing terms to maturity, taking into account changes in interest rates, credit risk and liquidity.  The allocation may span across the short and longer dated interest bearing security markets and will not have any duration limitation. This will necessitate actively switching out of longer dated interest bearing securities into shorter dated interest bearing securities and vice versa depending on market valuations. This strategy will result in a larger tracking error relative to the Benchmark. Investment strategies may include interest rate or duration positions, credit yield enhancement and the use of derivatives strategies. The Fund will be mark-to-marketed on a daily basis.The portfolio is permitted to invest in listed and unlisted financial instruments in line with the conditions as determined by legislation from time to time. The portfolio will predominately invest in South African markets, but is however permitted to include investments in offshore jurisdictions subject to the investment conditions determined by the Registrar from time to time.The portfolio will be subject to the Prudential Investment Guidelines for South African Retirement Funds, being Regulation 28 of the Pension Funds Act, or such other Legislation published from time to time. The portfolio may apart from assets in liquid form also include participatory interests or any other form of participation in portfolios of collective investment schemes or other similar schemes. Where the aforementioned schemes are operated in territories other than in South Africa, participatory interests or any other form of participation in these schemes will be included in the portfolio only where the regulatory environment is to the satisfaction of the manager and trustee and is of a sufficient standard to provide investor protection at least equivalent to that in South Africa.Nothing in the supplemental deed shall preclude the Manager from varying the ratios of securities, to maximise capital growth and investment potential in changing economic environments or market conditions or to meet the requirements, if applicable, of any exchange formally recognised in terms of legislation and from retaining cash or placing cash on deposit in terms of the Deed and any Supplemental Deeds thereto; provided that the Manager shall ensure that the aggregate value of the assets comprising the portfolio shall consist of securities of the aggregate value required from time to time by the Act. The Trustee shall ensure that the investment policy set out in this supplemental deed, the Deed and in all Supplemental Deeds thereto is carried out. For the purpose of this portfolio, the manager in consultation with the Investment Manager shall reserve the right to close the portfolio to new investors on a date determined by the manager.  This will be done in order to be able to manage the portfolio in accordance with its mandate.  The manager may, once a portfolio has been closed, open that portfolio again to new investors on a date determined by the manager."

The fund invests in public and private sector bonds and deposits.This fund is suited for institutions and individuals requiring investment growth via the capital market with a high income.Why Choose This Fund?ΓùÅ┬á The fund provides an income stream in the form of half-yearly income payments and is therefore suitable as a core fund for persons who wish to invest in the bond market though a diversified portfolio and/or top up their income at six-monthly intervals. ΓùÅ┬á The prices may fluctuate depending upon market rates ie, if rates rise, prices go down and if rates drop, prices go up. ΓùÅ┬á The fund is actively managed in order to outperform the All Bond index.  Additional Fund InformationΓùÅ┬á The fund's name changed on 1 April 2004. The fund was previously called the Sanlam Gilt Fund. ΓùÅ┬á This fund is also available via certain LISPs (Linked Investment Services Providers), who levy their own fees. - Total Expense Ratio (TER): This fund (retail class) has a TER of 1.19%. For the period from 1 January 2007 to 31 March 2007 1.19% of the average net asset value of the portfolio were incurred as charges, levies and fees related to the management of the portfolio. The ratio does not include the cost of acquiring assets. A higher TER does not necessarily imply a poor return, nor does a low TER imply a good return. The current TER can not be regarded as an indication of future TERs."

    "objectives": "The Vunani BCI Bond Fund aims to achieve an investment medium for investors, which shall have as its primary objective maximum total return by primarily investing in bonds. The portfolio will be managed in compliance with prudential investment guidelines for retirement funds in South Africa to the extent allowed for by the Act. Investments to be included in the portfolio will comprise of liquid form and a combination gilts and interest bearing securities, including loan stock, semi-gilts, notes, debentures, debenture bonds, preference shares, money market instruments, bonds, corporate debt, convertible equities and non-equity securities. The portfolio may also invest in participatory interests or any other form of participation in portfolios of collective investment schemes or other similar collective investment schemes as the Act may allow from time to time, and which are consistent with the portfolio's investment policy. Where the aforementioned schemes are operated in territories other than South Africa, participatory interests or any other form of participation in portfolios of these schemes will be included in the portfolio only where the regulatory environment is, to the satisfaction of the manager and the trustee, of sufficient standard to provide investor protection at least equal to that in South Africa. The portfolio may from time to time invest in listed and unlisted financial instruments, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, and the Regulations thereto, as amended from time to time, in order to achieve the portfolio's investment objective. The Trustee shall ensure that the investment policy set out in this Supplemental Deed is carried out."
