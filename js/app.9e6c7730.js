ΓùÅ┬á The prices may fluctuate depending upon market rates ie, if rates rise, prices go down and if rates drop, prices go up. ΓùÅ┬á The fund is actively managed in order to outperform the All Bond index.  Additional Fund InformationΓùÅ┬á The fund\'s name changed on 1 April 2004. The fund was previously called the Sanlam Gilt Fund. ΓùÅ┬á This fund is also available via certain LISPs (Linked Investment Services Providers), who levy their own fees. - Total Expense Ratio (TER): This fund (retail class) has a TER of 1.19%.
